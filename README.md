# Predicting Housing Prices FL-Region in-US

The goal of this project is to help out my neighbor, a real estate agent, who asked for some help on predicting housing prices for FL regions in the USA. In the context of ML, my work will be principally focused on creating the most suitable models that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

# Methodology:

•	End to end Machine learning process in python to create and compare multiple models to predict the price of house based on the variables in the data set

    Data Acquisition => Data Cleaning => Train Dataset => Train ML Model => Test Model => Evaluate Model => Deploy Model
    
•	Use Scikit-Learn machine learning library

•	Use various python tools for data acquisition, cleaning and visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

•	Use the power of Tableau for specific visualizations

•	Data sources: Zillow housing data , ZIP atlas 

# Visualization and Analysis:
